# Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of two key datasets:

1. **COVID-19 Dataset**: This dataset provides a daily cumulative count of positive cases in various countries.

2. **Global Happiness Worldwide Dataset**: This dataset contains scores for various aspects of life as reported by people living in countries around the globe.

The primary objective of this project is to merge these two datasets and explore potential relationships between the spread of the coronavirus and the overall happiness and well-being of people living in each country.

## Key Skills Developed

Throughout the course of this project, we've gained expertise in several crucial areas, including:

- **Python Programming**: Proficiency in Python for data analysis and manipulation.

- **Data Analysis**: Analyzing and interpreting data to draw meaningful insights.

- **Statistics**: Utilizing statistical methods to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.

- **Data Visualization**: Creating informative and visually appealing plots and graphs using libraries such as Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.


This project not only explores the dynamic between public health and well-being but also equips us with a diverse skill set in data analysis and programming.
