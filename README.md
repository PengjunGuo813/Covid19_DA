In this project, we've utilized two distinct datasets:
1. The COVID-19 dataset, which tracks the cumulative daily rate of positive cases across various countries.
2. The Global Happiness dataset, which provides scores for various aspects of life as reported by people in countries worldwide.

Our project's main objective was to combine these two datasets to investigate potential correlations between the spread of the coronavirus and the overall well-being of individuals residing in each country.

Throughout the course of this project, we've cultivated and honed several essential skills, including proficiency in:

<li>Python Programming
<li>Data Analysis
<li>Statistical Analysis
<li>Data visualization using Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.

This project has not only allowed us to explore the interplay between health and happiness but also to develop a diverse skill set in data analysis and programming.
