# Covid19_DA

In this project, we are provided with two distinct datasets. 
<li>The first dataset, COVID-19 data, provides a daily cumulative count of positive cases in different countries. 
<li>The second dataset, the Global Happiness dataset, assesses various life factors as scored by individuals in each country worldwide.

The primary objective of this project is to combine these two datasets to investigate potential connections between the spread of the coronavirus and the overall happiness of people in each country.

Throughout the course of this project, I honed various skills, including:

Python Programming
Data analysis
Statistics
Utilization of data visualization libraries like Seaborn, Pandas, Matplotlib
Proficiency in data manipulation using Numpy
